# Combat System

## Core Philosophy

**"Conscious but Decisive"** - Real-time tactical combat where skill comes from positioning, reading threats, and resource management. No twitch mechanics required.

**Design Pillars:**
* Directional combat (face your enemies, position matters, no cursor required)
* Hex-based resolution (abilities affect hexes, not pixel-perfect hitboxes)
* Reaction-based defense (incoming damage enters a queue with time to respond)
* Resource management over cooldown juggling (stamina/mana costs, minimal cooldowns)
* Build identity shapes playstyle (attributes determine reaction capacity and offensive power)

**Inspiration:** MOBA-style ability targeting meets Monster Hunter's deliberate combat pacing, adapted for hex grid MMO.

## Offensive Layer

### Movement and Heading

**Movement Controls:**
* **Arrow keys** to move between adjacent hexes
* **Left/Right:** East/West movement (absolute directions)
* **Up/Down:** Context-sensitive diagonal movement for pointy-top hex grid
  - Movement direction depends on your current axis
  - Enables full 6-directional hex movement with 4 arrow keys
* Movement automatically updates your heading (facing direction)
* Your position on the hex shifts to face the direction you're moving
* No "turn in place" command - heading only updates through movement
* No mouse required - fully keyboard controlled

**Heading Mechanics:**
* Heading persists after you stop moving (you continue facing that direction)
* **Facing cone: 60 degrees** (one hex-face direction in hexagonal grid)
* Heading determines:
  - Character rotation (visual facing)
  - Position on hex (tactical micro-positioning)
  - Target selection (what's "in front" of you within 60¬∞ cone)
  - Ability direction (projectiles, lines, cones)

**Visual Clarity:**
* Character sprite rotates to face heading
* Character positioned on hex to indicate facing (not centered if moving)
* Optional facing cone indicator (60¬∞ arc overlay) shows targeting area

### Targeting System

All combat is **directional** - you face a direction and abilities target based on your heading and proximity.

**Player Heading:**
* Players always face a direction after their first move
* Heading determines both rotation AND position on hex (tactical positioning)
* No manual "turn in place" - movement updates heading
* Your facing is always visually clear (character orientation, position on hex)

**Target Selection:**
* Your "target" is determined by direction + proximity
* Basic attacks hit the **nearest hostile within range in the direction you're facing**
* No clicking, no cursor - just face enemies and attack

**Target Indicators:**

Players see TWO target indicators:
* üî¥ **Hostile target** (red): One hostile based on current tier and facing direction
* üü¢ **Ally target** (green): Nearest ally in facing direction

Only ONE hostile is targeted at a time. Indicator shows which enemy/ally will be affected by abilities.

**Range Tiers:**

Targeting searches within range bands:
* **Tier 1 (Close)**: 1-2 hexes
* **Tier 2 (Mid)**: 3-6 hexes
* **Tier 3 (Far)**: 7+ hexes

**Tier Selection:**

*Automatic (Default):*
* Default tier = nearest hostile in facing direction (any range)
* Geometric tiebreaker: closest to exact facing angle (most "in front" of you)
* No button presses needed for standard flow

*Manual (Tier Lock):*
* Press number key to temporarily lock to a specific tier:
  - **1** = Search for targets in Close range (1-2 hexes)
  - **2** = Search for targets in Mid range (3-6 hexes)
  - **3** = Search for targets in Far range (7+ hexes)
* Target indicator switches to nearest hostile within that tier
* **If no targets in tier:** Lock remains active, continuously searching that range
  - Visual feedback: Tier range highlighted (shows empty search area)
  - When enemy enters tier range, they become target immediately
* **Tier lock drops after 1 ability use** ‚Üí returns to default (nearest any range)
* Allows quick target switching without repositioning

*Example Flow:*
```
Scenario: Warrior fighting NPC dog (range 1), hostile player approaches (range 7)

1. Default: Red indicator on dog (nearest, range 1)
2. Press "3" (far tier lock) ‚Üí indicator switches to player (nearest in far tier)
3. Press "Q" (Charge gap closer) ‚Üí charges at player
4. Tier lock drops ‚Üí indicator returns to nearest (now player at range 1)
5. Press "W" (Overpower) ‚Üí hits player immediately
```

*Manual (TAB Cycle):*
* TAB cycles through all valid targets in current tier
* If multiple hostiles exist in same tier, TAB lets you choose which
* Manual TAB lock persists until:
  - You press ESC (clear override, return to default)
  - Selected target dies or becomes invalid
  - You move/rotate significantly (changes valid target list)
  - You change tier (press 1/2/3)

**Design Rationale:**
* Single indicator = clear, unambiguous targeting
* Tier lock solves "caster wants backline" problem
* Single-ability tier lock prevents "stuck" feeling
* TAB handles equidistant edge cases
* Geometric default rewards positioning
* Works without responsive movement (tier lock as fallback)

**Visual Feedback:**
* Default targeting: Red indicator on nearest hostile
* Tier lock active: Indicator shows tier number/icon (small "3" badge on far target)
* Tier lock with no targets: Tier range highlighted in facing cone (shows empty search area)
* TAB lock: Additional border/marker to show manual selection
* Target out of ability range: Indicator dims or shows range error on cast attempt
* Facing cone: Optional 60¬∞ arc overlay to show targeting area

**Ability Patterns:**
* **Single Target** - Hits the indicated target (nearest in direction + range)
* **Self Target** - Affects caster only (buffs, self-heals) - no targeting required, press key to cast
* **Line Pattern** - Affects N hexes in a line from you in your facing direction
* **Radius Pattern** - Affects all hexes within distance R from you
* **Adjacent** - Affects hexes directly adjacent to you (all 6 or frontal arc)
* **Point-Blank AOE (PBAoE)** - Affects area centered on you - no targeting required

**Hit Detection:** If an entity occupies the targeted hex when the ability resolves, they are hit.

### Attack Execution Patterns

**Instant Attacks:**
* Resolve immediately on cast
* Target based on facing direction + proximity at moment of cast
* Typically melee/adjacent hex abilities
* Example: Basic sword strike, Charge (Direct signature)

**Projectile Attacks:**
* Projectile spawns and travels toward target hex
* Targets the hostile/ally indicated at moment of cast
* Projectile travels in straight line toward target's location (snapshot)
* If target moves after cast, projectile continues to original hex (dodgeable!)
* Provides visual warning before impact (see it coming)
* Speed varies by ability (arrow fast, fireball slow)
* Hit detection: Damages entities at impact hex when projectile arrives
* Example: Volley (Distant signature), basic ranged attack
* **Player Interaction:** Face target, press ability ‚Üí projectile fires at indicated target

**Ground Effects:**
* Telegraph appears on target hexes before damage resolves
* Target area determined by ability pattern + your heading:
  - Single target: Telegraphs at indicated target's hex
  - Radius: Telegraphs radius around target hex
  - Line: Telegraphs line of hexes in your facing direction
* Fixed delay before resolution (1-3 seconds)
* Entities can move off telegraphed hexes to avoid damage
* Damage applies to any entity occupying hex when telegraph expires
* Example: Eruption (radiates outward), Trap (Ambushing signature)
* **Player Interaction:** Face direction/target, press ability ‚Üí telegraph appears ‚Üí damage after delay

**Unavoidable Attacks:**
* Bypass reaction queue system entirely
* Apply damage immediately with passive modifiers only
* Rare, expensive, ultimate-tier abilities
* Distinct visual/audio cues (cannot be mistaken for normal attacks)
* Example: True Strike, Piercing Shot

---

## Defensive Layer: Reaction Queue System

### Core Mechanic

When damage would hit an entity, it enters their **reaction queue** before applying damage.

**Queue Properties:**
* Each queued threat has an independent timer (circular progress indicator)
* Queue capacity = f(Focus attribute)
* Timer duration = f(Instinct attribute)
* When queue is full, **oldest threat resolves immediately** with passive modifiers
* Entity can use **reaction abilities** to clear threats before timers expire

### Queue Display

**Visual Representation:**
* Row of circular icons with depleting timers
* Left to right = order of resolution (soonest first)
* Each icon shows attack type/source (physical icon, fire icon, etc.)
* Timer ring depletes clockwise around icon

**Example:**
```
[‚öîÔ∏è ‚óè‚óè‚óã‚óã‚óã] [üî• ‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óã‚óã] [‚öîÔ∏è ‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óã]
  0.4s left   0.8s left   1.2s left
```

### Attribute Scaling

**Instinct (Reaction Speed):**
```
reaction_window = base_window * (1.0 + instinct / 200.0)

Examples:
- Instinct = -100: 0.5s window
- Instinct = 0: 1.0s window
- Instinct = 100: 1.5s window
```

**Focus (Mental Clarity):**
```
queue_capacity = base_capacity + floor(focus / 33.0)

Examples:
- Focus = -100: 1 threat capacity (everything else instant)
- Focus = 0: 3 threat capacity
- Focus = 100: 6 threat capacity
```

### Queue Resolution

**When timer expires (no reaction):**
* Damage applies with passive modifiers (armor, resistance, etc.)
* Threat removed from queue
* Next threat begins resolving

**When queue fills (new threat arrives):**
* **Oldest threat (leftmost) resolves immediately** with passive modifiers
* New threat takes rightmost position in queue
* All other threats shift left visually

**When reaction ability used:**
* Ability determines what clears (see Reaction Abilities below)
* Cleared threats removed from queue
* Remaining threats shift left to fill gaps

---

## Reaction Abilities

Abilities that interact with the reaction queue. Tied to Triumvirate signatures (build-dependent, not universal).

### Global Cooldown (GCD)

All reaction abilities share a **0.5 second global cooldown** to prevent spam.

* Using any reaction ability triggers GCD
* During GCD, no other reaction abilities can be used
* Queue timers continue during GCD (risk of overflow)

---

## Resources

### Stamina

**Purpose:** Physical actions (dodges, blocks, physical abilities)

**Attributes:**
* Pool size scales with **Might** (primary) and **Vitality** (secondary)
* Regeneration rate: Base 10/sec (may scale with attributes later)
* Regenerates in and out of combat

**Base Values:**
```
stamina_pool = 100 + (might * 0.5) + (vitality * 0.3)

Examples:
- Might=0, Vitality=0: 100 stamina
- Might=100, Vitality=0: 150 stamina
- Might=100, Vitality=100: 180 stamina
```

### Mana

**Purpose:** Magic actions (spells, wards, mental abilities)

**Attributes:**
* Pool size scales with **Focus** (primary) and **Presence** (secondary)
* Regeneration rate: Base 8/sec (may scale with attributes later)
* Regenerates in and out of combat

**Base Values:**
```
mana_pool = 100 + (focus * 0.5) + (presence * 0.3)

Examples:
- Focus=0, Presence=0: 100 mana
- Focus=100, Presence=0: 150 mana
- Focus=100, Presence=100: 180 mana
```

---

## Damage Calculation

### Outgoing Damage

**Physical Damage:**
```
damage = base_damage * (1.0 + might / 100.0) * (1.0 - target_armor)
```

**Magic Damage:**
```
damage = base_damage * (1.0 + focus / 100.0) * (1.0 - target_resistance)
```

**Critical Hits:**
```
crit_chance = base_crit + (instinct / 200.0)
crit_multiplier = 1.5 + (instinct / 200.0)

If crit: damage *= crit_multiplier
```

### Passive Modifiers (No Reaction)

When damage resolves without reaction ability, passive modifiers apply:

**Armor (Physical Reduction):**
```
armor = base_armor + (vitality / 200.0)

Examples:
- Vitality=-100: 0% reduction
- Vitality=0: 0% reduction
- Vitality=100: 50% reduction (capped at 75% max)
```

**Resistance (Magic Reduction):**
```
resistance = base_resistance + (focus / 200.0)

Examples:
- Focus=-100: 0% reduction
- Focus=0: 0% reduction
- Focus=100: 50% reduction (capped at 75% max)
```

**Stagger Resist:**
```
stagger_resist = vitality / 100.0

Determines likelihood of being interrupted during cast/channel.
```

## Combat State

### Engagement Triggers

Entity enters "in combat" state when:
* Deals damage to another entity
* Takes damage from another entity
* Is within aggro radius of hostile entity
* Uses offensive ability (even if it misses)

### Combat State Effects

While "in combat":
* Cannot mount/fast travel
* Stamina/mana regen rates apply
* Combat music plays
* Cannot interact with friendly NPCs/vendors
* UI shows combat elements (reaction queue, resource bars)

### Leaving Combat

Combat state ends when:
* No hostile entities within 20 hex radius
* 5 seconds have passed since last damage dealt/taken
* Entity dies

---

## Enemy AI Integration

### Enemy Targeting

Enemies use simplified directional targeting:
* Face toward target player (heading updates on movement)
* Target nearest hostile player in facing direction (same as player targeting)
* No tier lock or TAB cycling (AI uses geometric default only)
* Abilities fire at indicated target based on enemy's heading

### Basic Attack Pattern

**Simple Melee Enemy (Wild Dog):**
1. Detect player within aggro radius (10 hexes)
2. Face toward player, pathfind to adjacent hex
3. When adjacent and facing player, attack every 2-3 seconds
4. Attack enters player's reaction queue
5. If player moves away, turn to face and pursue
6. Leash if player exceeds 30 hex distance

**AI Behavior:**
* Continuously updates facing to track player
* Must be facing player to attack (adds slight delay if player circles)
* Creates opportunity for player to use positioning (stay behind enemy)

**Ranged Enemy (Forest Sprite):**
1. Detect player within aggro radius (15 hexes)
2. Face toward player
3. Maintain distance of 5-8 hexes (kite if player approaches)
4. Attack every 3-4 seconds (projectile with travel time)
5. If player closes within 3 hexes, disengage (move away while maintaining facing)

**AI Behavior:**
* Kiting enemies back-pedal while maintaining facing (harder to flank)
* Projectiles snapshot player position (player can dodge by moving)

### Telegraph System

Enemies broadcast intent before major attacks:

**Visual Telegraph:**
* Ground indicator on target hexes (red outline or fill)
* Enemy wind-up animation (arm raise, charging effect)
* Duration: 0.5-2.0 seconds depending on attack power

**Purpose:**
* Gives player time to reposition (move off targeted hex)
* Creates skill expression (reading patterns, baiting attacks)
* Distinguishes dangerous abilities from basic attacks

---

## Mutual Destruction

**Scenario:** Both combatants have lethal damage queued simultaneously.

**Outcome:** Both entities die.

**Design Intent:**
* Rewards aggressive play with inherent risk
* Creates dramatic "we both went for it" moments
* No arbitrary "tie-breaker" rules

**Example:**
1. Player A casts Fireball at Player B (lethal damage)
2. Player B casts Lightning at Player A (lethal damage)
3. Both projectiles travel and hit simultaneously
4. Both enter reaction queues
5. Neither player reacts (out of resources or committed to trade)
6. Both die

---

## MVP Scope (Phase 1)

## Controls and Keybindings

**Two-Handed Keyboard Layout (No Mouse Required):**

### Movement (Right Hand)
* **Arrow Keys**: Move between adjacent hexes, updates heading
* **‚Üê/‚Üí**: East/West movement (absolute directions)
* **‚Üë/‚Üì**: Context-sensitive diagonal movement (pointy-top hex grid)
  - Full 6-directional movement with 4 keys
  - Direction depends on your current movement axis
* Your character faces the direction you last moved

### Combat Abilities (Left Hand)
* **Q**: Ability slot 1 (Example: Basic Attack)
* **W**: Ability slot 2 (Example: Secondary ability)
* **E**: Ability slot 3 (Example: Dodge/Reaction ability)
* **R**: Ability slot 4 (Example: Ultimate/Special ability)
* Abilities target current hostile/ally indicator or self (depending on ability)

### Targeting (Left Hand)
* **Automatic:** Target indicator shows nearest hostile in facing direction (60¬∞ cone)
* **1**: Tier lock close range (1-2 hexes), persists until 1 ability used
* **2**: Tier lock mid range (3-6 hexes), persists until 1 ability used
* **3**: Tier lock far range (7+ hexes), persists until 1 ability used
* **TAB**: Cycle through valid targets in current tier (manual lock until ESC or target invalid)
* **ESC**: Clear manual targeting, return to automatic

### Visual Indicators
* **Red indicator:** Current hostile target (what you'll attack)
* **Green indicator:** Current ally target (for friendly abilities)
* **Tier badge:** Small number (1/2/3) shows tier lock active
* **Tier highlight:** Range visualization when tier lock has no valid targets
* **Lock marker:** Additional border shows TAB manual lock active

**Note:**
* Exact keybindings configurable, these are defaults
* Design specifically avoids mouse for accessibility and controller support
* Detailed movement mechanics for pointy-top hex grid can be documented separately if needed

## Open Questions

**UI/UX:**
* Where should reaction queue display on screen? (above character? bottom center?)
* How prominent should target indicators be? (subtle outline vs big icon vs ground marker?)
* Should target indicators include distance markers? (show hex count to target)
* How to show facing/heading clearly? (character rotation sufficient? add arrow/cone?)
* Should tier lock show range visualization? (highlight valid hexes in tier)
* How to distinguish between auto-target and manual-lock visually?
* Should target indicators be color-coded AND have symbols? (colorblind accessibility)
* How to distinguish unavoidable attacks visually? (different color? sound?)
* Should abilities show "out of range" warning before cast? (indicator dims if too far)

**Balance:**
* Are base resource pools (100 stamina/mana) correct?
* Is 0.5s GCD too punishing or too lenient?
* Should armor cap at 75% reduction or lower/higher?
* Are range tiers correct? (1-2 close, 3-6 mid, 7+ far)
* Should enemies get facing bonus/penalty? (backstab damage, frontal armor)

**Directional Combat:**
* ‚úÖ **Facing cone: 60 degrees** (decided - one hex-face direction)
* Should moving backwards be slower than forward? (incentivize facing enemies) - Needs playtesting
* Should abilities have facing requirements? (some abilities only work if target is in front)
* How much does heading/position on hex matter geometrically? (for tiebreakers)
* Movement speed/responsiveness? - Needs playtesting to balance feel vs tactical play

**Scope:**
* Should MVP include health bars for enemies? (assumed yes)
* Should MVP include death animations/loot drops? (or just despawn?)
* Should stamina regen be visible (floating numbers) or just bar fill?
* Should MVP include target indicators? (yes - critical for directional combat)
* Should MVP include tier lock system? (or just auto-target for simplicity)

---

## Design Goals Achieved

* ‚úÖ **Conscious but decisive** - Reaction windows give time to think, GCD demands commitment
* ‚úÖ **No twitch mechanics** - Directional targeting and timed reactions, not pixel-perfect aiming
* ‚úÖ **Positioning matters** - Facing, heading, and geometric targeting reward tactical positioning
* ‚úÖ **Build identity matters** - Instinct/Focus directly shape defensive playstyle
* ‚úÖ **Resource management is tactical** - Stamina/mana costs create meaningful decisions
* ‚úÖ **Mutual destruction possible** - Emergent drama from simultaneous lethal damage
* ‚úÖ **Clear feedback** - Queue UI and target indicators show exactly what's happening
* ‚úÖ **Skill expression** - Mastery comes from reading fights, managing resources, and positioning
* ‚úÖ **No cursor required** - Fully playable with keyboard, controller-friendly design
* ‚úÖ **Emergent tactics** - Tier lock and geometric targeting create depth without complexity
