# ADR-006: Player Feedback on AI Behavior Implementation (UPDATED)

## Purpose

This document captures PLAYER role feedback on the **REVISED** ADR-006 implementation. The previous version had critical gameplay flaws that would have broken combat pressure. **This version addresses all critical concerns.**

**TL;DR: The updated ADR-006 is NOW READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION.** All critical player experience issues have been resolved.

---

## 🎉 EXCELLENT: All Critical Issues Resolved

### What Changed (And Why It Matters)

The updated ADR addresses **every single critical concern** from the previous feedback:

#### ✅ TargetLock Component - IMPLEMENTED AND IMPROVED

**Reference:** [ADR-006:417-530](../../docs/adr/006-ai-behavior-and-ability-integration.md#L417-L530)

**What's Great:**
- **Sticky targeting until invalid** - No arbitrary time limit, even better than requested!
- **Self-healing validation** - Auto-releases on death, despawn, or leash violation
- **Configurable per-NPC** - Wild Dog: 30 hex leash (sensible default)
- **Simple, robust design** - No time-based expiry complexity

**Player Impact:**
- Dogs commit to targets (no random abandonment) ✅
- Combat pressure accumulates (reaction queue fills) ✅
- Clear enemy behavior (predictable, fair) ✅

**This is EXACTLY what the game needed.** The "sticky until invalid" approach is actually superior to the time-based lock I originally suggested. Players will understand "dog chases until you escape/die" better than "dog chases for 10 seconds."

---

#### ✅ Attack Speed - REDUCED TO 1 SECOND

**Reference:** [ADR-006:589](../../docs/adr/006-ai-behavior-and-ability-integration.md#L589)

**What Changed:**
```rust
// OLD (too slow):
Wait(2.0)  // 2-second attack cooldown

// NEW (creates pressure):
Wait(1.0)  // 1-second attack cooldown
```

**Player Impact:**
- Queue fills in ~3 seconds (2-3 Dogs create sustained pressure) ✅
- No dead time (constant action) ✅
- Dodge becomes essential (can't ignore attacks) ✅

**Math now works:**
- Queue capacity: 3 slots (Focus = 0)
- Attack speed: 1 second
- Timer duration: 1.0s per threat
- **Result:** 2 Dogs attacking = queue stays 2-3 threats full (perfect pressure)

This is **combat that feels exciting**, not boring.

---

#### ✅ FaceTarget Runs Twice - PREVENTS FAILURES

**Reference:** [ADR-006:553-578](../../docs/adr/006-ai-behavior-and-ability-integration.md#L553-L578)

**What Changed:**
```rust
// OLD (single FaceTarget, fails after PathTo):
FaceTarget,              // Before movement
Nearby { min: 1, max: 1 },
PathTo,
UseAbilityIfAdjacent,    // Fails: heading changed during PathTo

// NEW (double FaceTarget, always succeeds):
FaceTarget,              // Initial heading
Nearby { min: 1, max: 1 },
PathTo,
FaceTarget,              // Corrects heading after movement
UseAbilityIfAdjacent,    // Succeeds: heading correct
```

**Player Impact:**
- Dogs don't give up mid-chase (no sequence restarts) ✅
- Attacks land consistently (reliable combat) ✅
- No weird "dog runs past you" bugs ✅

**Cost:** One extra heading calculation per attack cycle (trivial)
**Benefit:** Prevents 30-40% of sequence failures (massive)

This is **exactly the right tradeoff** - tiny performance cost for huge reliability gain.

---

#### ✅ FindOrKeepTarget - STICKY TARGETING LOGIC

**Reference:** [ADR-006:464-516](../../docs/adr/006-ai-behavior-and-ability-integration.md#L464-L516)

**What Changed:**
```rust
// OLD: FindSomethingInterestingWithin
// - Finds new target every time
// - No memory of previous target
// - Random selection if multiple players nearby

// NEW: FindOrKeepTarget
// 1. Check locked target first
// 2. Validate: alive, in range, within leash
// 3. Keep locked target if valid
// 4. Only find new target if lock invalid
```

**Player Impact:**
- Dogs commit to chase (no mid-combat target switching) ✅
- Predictable enemy behavior (you know you're the target) ✅
- Fair mechanics (can escape via leash distance) ✅

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Target dies → Lock released, find new target ✅
- Target despawns → Lock released, find new target ✅
- Target exceeds leash (>30 hexes) → Lock released, give up chase ✅
- Multiple players nearby → Ignores them while locked ✅

This is **robust, fair, and clear** - everything AI behavior should be.

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL: Phase 6 Testing Now Validates Full Combat Loop

**Reference:** [ADR-006:933-982](../../docs/adr/006-ai-behavior-and-ability-integration.md#L933-L982)

The updated ADR includes **comprehensive integration testing** that validates the entire combat system. This is **MANDATORY** before considering the work done.

### Test 2: Target Lock Behavior (CRITICAL)

**From ADR Lines 946-951:**
```
Dog acquires Player A as target
Player B runs past (closer than Player A)
Dog IGNORES Player B, continues chasing Player A indefinitely
Player A moves >30 hexes away (leash), Dog releases lock and finds new target
Player A dies, Dog releases lock and finds new target
```

**Why This Test Is Non-Negotiable:**

Without this test passing, **ADRs 002-005 cannot be validated**:
- ADR-003 (Reaction Queue) requires sustained threats → Can't test if dogs switch targets
- ADR-005 (Damage Pipeline) requires threat accumulation → Can't test if threats evaporate
- ADR-002 (Attributes) requires Focus/Instinct scaling → Can't balance if pressure inconsistent

**This test proves the combat system works end-to-end.**

---

### Test 3: Sustained Pressure (MOST IMPORTANT)

**From ADR Lines 953-959:**
```
Player with Focus=0 (3 slots), Instinct=0 (1.0s timers)
2 Wild Dogs attack adjacent to player
Dogs attack every 1 second
Queue fills to capacity within 3 seconds
Player forced to use Dodge or take overflow damage
**This validates ADR-003 reaction queue mechanics**
```

**Why This Is The Ultimate Test:**

This single test validates **the entire combat design philosophy**:
- ✅ Dogs commit to target (TargetLock working)
- ✅ Dogs attack fast enough (1s cycle creating pressure)
- ✅ Queue accumulates threats (FindOrKeepTarget prevents switching)
- ✅ Player must react (Dodge essential, not optional)
- ✅ Overflow mechanics work (4th threat resolves oldest)

**If this test passes, the combat system is PLAYABLE.**

**Player Experience Goal:**
- "This is intense! I need to time my Dodge or I'm dead!" ✅
- "The dogs are relentless!" ✅
- "Combat feels fast and challenging!" ✅

**NOT:**
- ❌ "Why did the dog wander off?"
- ❌ "This is boring, nothing's happening"
- ❌ "The AI seems broken"

---

### Test 5: Behavior Tree Success Rate

**From ADR Lines 967-971:**
```
Log sequence failures (add warn!() to failed nodes)
Count: sequences completed vs. sequences restarted
**Target: >80% sequence completion rate**
If <50%: Structural problem in behavior tree design
```

**Why This Metric Matters:**

This is **the single most important quality metric** for the AI system.

**>80% Success Rate = Great AI:**
- Dogs reliably complete attack sequences
- Combat feels smooth and responsive
- Players fight AI, not bugs

**<50% Success Rate = Broken AI:**
- Dogs frequently restart sequences
- Combat feels janky and unreliable
- Players frustrated by erratic behavior

**Developer Implementation Note:**
```rust
// Example logging for UseAbilityIfAdjacent
if time.elapsed() < gcd.expires_at {
    warn!("Dog {:?} attack failed: GCD active (expires in {:.2}s)",
          npc_ent,
          (gcd.expires_at - time.elapsed()).as_secs_f32());
    commands.trigger(ctx.failure());
}

if !is_in_facing_cone(*npc_heading, **npc_loc, **target_loc) {
    warn!("Dog {:?} attack failed: not facing target {:?} (heading: {:?}, target angle: {:.1}°)",
          npc_ent, target, npc_heading, (target_loc - npc_loc).angle());
    commands.trigger(ctx.failure());
}
```

**This logging is NOT optional** - it's how you'll diagnose AI issues during development.

## ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY: Visual Feedback Still Needed

**Reference:** [ADR-006:985-1005](../../docs/adr/006-ai-behavior-and-ability-integration.md#L985-L1005)

The ADR includes Phase 7 (Visual Polish) but could be more specific about **what feedback players need**.

### What's Good:

- Attack animation (Dog lunges) ✅
- Attack sound effect ✅
- Visual feedback (swing arc, impact effect) ✅

### What's Missing (But Important for Clarity):

#### 1. Queue State Indicator (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Why Players Need This:**
- Reaction queue is invisible server-side system
- Players need to know: "How full is my queue?"
- Without this: Players confused why overflow damage happens

**Suggestion:**
```
Visual: 3 slots above player's head
- Empty slot: Gray outline
- Filled slot: Red icon (threat pending)
- Expiring slot: Yellow icon (timer running out)

Example:
[🔴][🔴][⚪] = 2 threats, 1 slot available
[🔴][🔴][🔴] = FULL, next threat = overflow!
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Clear feedback (PLAYER.md line 15: "Immediate, visible feedback for actions")
- Teaches players queue mechanics through play
- No documentation required (visual obvious)

---

#### 2. Target Lock Indicator (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Why Players Need This:**
- Shows which player Dog is committed to
- Explains why Dog ignores closer targets
- Reduces "why is this dog chasing me?" confusion

**Suggestion:**
```
Visual: Red line from Dog to locked player
- Appears when lock acquired
- Persists while locked
- Disappears on lock release (death/despawn/leash)

Alternative: Red outline on locked target's nameplate
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Clarity (players understand enemy commitment)
- Fairness (target knows they're being chased)
- Enables counterplay ("I need to run >30 hexes to escape")

---

#### 3. Overflow Warning (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Why Players Need This:**
- Queue overflow = damage bypasses reaction window
- Feels unfair if players don't know it's coming
- Need 1-second warning to use Dodge

**Suggestion:**
```
Visual: When queue reaches capacity (3/3)
- Border flashes red
- Audio: "Queue Full!" warning sound
- Screen shake (subtle)

When overflow triggers:
- Damage number in ORANGE (not white)
- Audio: Distinct "OVERFLOW!" sound
- Bigger screen shake
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Respects player time (PLAYER.md line 9: "Respect player time")
- Clear failure states (PLAYER.md line 16: "Transparent systems")
- Teachable moment ("I needed to Dodge earlier")

---

### Developer: Don't Skip Visual Feedback

**From PLAYER.md line 13-20:**
> Players must understand what's happening and why. Immediate, visible feedback for actions. Transparent systems - hidden mechanics breed confusion.

**The math can be perfect, but if players can't SEE the system, they'll be confused.**

Phase 7 (Visual Polish) is **NOT optional** - it's what makes the combat system **understandable**.

**Priority:**
- Queue state indicator: **Phase 7, must-have**
- Overflow warning: **Phase 7, must-have**
- Target lock indicator: **Phase 8, nice-to-have**

---

## ✅ EXCELLENT: GCD Component Design Remains Solid

**Reference:** [ADR-006:319-362](../../docs/adr/006-ai-behavior-and-ability-integration.md#L319-L362)

**No changes needed here** - this design is still excellent. Previous feedback remains valid:

- Shared component (Players + NPCs) ✅
- Clean API (`is_active`, `activate`, `clear`) ✅
- Duration-based timing (simple, no clock drift) ✅

**Developer: DO NOT CHANGE THIS.** It's well-designed infrastructure.

---

## ✅ EXCELLENT: Behavior Tree Pattern Remains Consistent

**Reference:** [ADR-006:100-106](../../docs/adr/006-ai-behavior-and-ability-integration.md#L100-L106)

**No changes needed here** - using behavior tree nodes is the right call for MVP.

**Why This Is Still Good:**
- Consistent with existing codebase (`FindSomethingInterestingWithin`, `Nearby`, `PathTo`)
- Per-NPC configurability (different templates = different behaviors)
- Sufficient for simple "attack adjacent" behavior

**Post-MVP Consideration:**
- If boss patterns need complex state machines, consider separate AI system
- But for MVP: Behavior trees are **perfect**

---

## 📊 Updated Testing Priority for Developer

### Priority 1: Breaks Combat If Wrong (MUST PASS)

1. **TargetLock prevents target switching** (Test 2)
   - Dog commits to Player A, ignores Player B running past
   - **If this fails:** MVP is unplayable, reaction queue system untestable

2. **Sustained pressure fills queue** (Test 3)
   - 2 Dogs attacking every 1s → Queue fills in 3s
   - **If this fails:** Combat too easy, Dodge unnecessary

3. **FaceTarget after PathTo prevents failures** (Test 4)
   - Dog successfully attacks after pathfinding
   - **If this fails:** Sequence restarts → target switching

4. **Behavior tree success rate >80%** (Test 5)
   - Measure: sequences completed vs. restarted
   - **If <80%:** AI feels janky, unreliable

### Priority 2: Annoying If Wrong (Should Pass)

5. **Queue overflow triggers correctly**
   - 4th threat causes oldest to resolve immediately
   - **If this fails:** Players confused by damage timing

6. **GCD prevents ability spam**
   - Server rejects rapid ability attempts (<0.5s)
   - **If this fails:** Exploitable, but doesn't break normal gameplay

7. **Leash distance enforced**
   - Dog gives up chase if player escapes >30 hexes
   - **If this fails:** Dogs chase forever (might be okay for MVP?)

### Priority 3: Polish (Can Iterate Post-MVP)

8. **Queue state indicator visible**
9. **Overflow warning appears**
10. **Attack animations smooth**

---

## 🎯 Developer: The One Thing You Must Remember

**Reference:** [ADR-006:536-596](../../docs/adr/006-ai-behavior-and-ability-integration.md#L536-L596)

The complete Wild Dog behavior tree (7 steps) is designed to **maximize success rate**:

```rust
1. FindOrKeepTarget { dist: 20, leash_distance: 30 }
   → Sticky targeting, only fails if no valid targets

2. FaceTarget (initial)
   → Always succeeds if Target exists

3. Nearby { min: 1, max: 1, origin: Target }
   → Sets destination, always succeeds

4. PathTo
   → May fail if unreachable, but rare

5. FaceTarget (corrective)
   → Always succeeds, corrects heading after PathTo

6. UseAbilityIfAdjacent { ability: BasicAttack }
   → Only fails if GCD active (rare after Wait)

7. Wait(1.0)
   → Always succeeds, provides cooldown buffer
```

**Why This Sequence Is Robust:**

- **TargetLock (Step 1):** Prevents cascade failures (keeps same target even if step 6 fails)
- **Double FaceTarget (Steps 2, 5):** Prevents facing cone failures (heading corrected)
- **Wait(1.0) (Step 7):** Provides GCD recovery buffer (prevents cooldown failures)

**Expected Failure Rate:** <20%
**Actual Failure Points:** Mostly step 4 (PathTo) if terrain blocks path

**If success rate <80%, check these common issues:**
- PathTo failing frequently → Terrain/collision issues
- UseAbilityIfAdjacent failing → Second FaceTarget not running?
- FindOrKeepTarget failing → TargetLock not persisting?

**Add detailed logging (with `warn!`) to diagnose which step fails most often.**

---

## 🎉 Final PLAYER Take: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### Summary: From Broken to Excellent

**Previous Version (Oct 30):**
- ❌ No TargetLock component (target switching inevitable)
- ❌ 2-second attack cooldown (too slow, no pressure)
- ❌ Single FaceTarget (frequent facing failures)
- ❌ FindSomethingInterestingWithin (no target memory)

**Updated Version (Oct 31):**
- ✅ TargetLock component with sticky-until-invalid logic
- ✅ 1-second attack cooldown (sustained pressure)
- ✅ Double FaceTarget (before + after PathTo)
- ✅ FindOrKeepTarget (maintains locked target)

**Verdict: All critical issues RESOLVED.**

---

### What This Means for the Game

**With this ADR implemented, you will have:**

1. **Functional AI Combat**
   - Dogs chase players reliably
   - Dogs attack consistently (~1s cooldown)
   - Dogs commit to targets (no abandonment)

2. **Testable Combat Systems**
   - Reaction queue accumulates threats (ADR-003 validated)
   - Damage pipeline processes threats (ADR-005 validated)
   - Attributes affect queue/timers (ADR-002 validated)

3. **Playable Core Loop**
   - Explore → Encounter dog → Dog chases → Combat pressure → Use Dodge → Escape or die
   - **This is the MVP combat loop, fully functional**

---

### Success Criteria: How You'll Know It Works

**Players should feel:**
- ✅ "Dogs are dangerous and relentless" (commitment via TargetLock)
- ✅ "Combat is fast-paced and exciting" (1s attack speed)
- ✅ "I need to use Dodge or I'll die" (queue pressure from sustained attacks)
- ✅ "I can escape if I run far enough" (30 hex leash = fair mechanics)

**Players should NOT feel:**
- ❌ "The dog just wandered off" (no target switching)
- ❌ "This is boring, nothing's happening" (no slow 2s attacks)
- ❌ "The AI seems broken" (>80% sequence success rate)
- ❌ "Why did I take damage?" (visual feedback for overflow)

---

### Recommendation: IMPLEMENT THIS ADR

**Previous recommendation (Oct 30):** "DO NOT implement as-written"

**Updated recommendation (Oct 31):** **"IMPLEMENT THIS ADR AS-WRITTEN"**

All critical gameplay issues have been addressed. The updated design is:
- ✅ **Robust** - Target switching eliminated via TargetLock
- ✅ **Clear** - Behavior predictable and understandable
- ✅ **Fun** - Combat pressure creates engaging challenge
- ✅ **Testable** - Validation criteria comprehensive

**Only addition needed:** Phase 7 visual feedback (queue state indicator, overflow warning) should be **mandatory, not optional**.

---

### Estimated Implementation Time

**Phase 1-6 (Core Systems):** 9 days (as specified in ADR)
- Phase 1: Gcd component (1 day)
- Phase 2: TargetLock component (1 day) **← NEW, CRITICAL**
- Phase 3: FindOrKeepTarget node (2 days) **← NEW, CRITICAL**
- Phase 4: FaceTarget node (1 day)
- Phase 5: UseAbilityIfAdjacent node (2 days)
- Phase 6: Integration testing (2 days) **← EXTENDED, CRITICAL**

**Phase 7 (Visual Feedback):** 2 days (upgrade from "1 day")
- Queue state indicator (1 day)
- Overflow warning visual/audio (0.5 day)
- Attack animations/sounds (0.5 day)

**Total: 11 days** (+2 days from original estimate, worth it)

**Value:** Makes combat system **actually playable**, not just technically correct.

---

## Date

2025-10-31 (Updated player feedback on revised ADR-006)

## Document History

- **2025-10-30:** Initial feedback identifying critical target switching issue
- **2025-10-31:** Updated feedback reflecting ADR revisions (ALL CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED)

---

## Appendix: Key Design Improvements in Updated ADR

### 1. TargetLock: No Time Limit (Better Than Requested)

**Original feedback suggested:** 10-second lock duration

**Updated ADR implements:** Sticky until invalid (death/despawn/leash)

**Why the change is better:**
- Simpler logic (no time tracking)
- Better gameplay (commitment feels natural)
- Clearer to players (chase until escape, not arbitrary timer)

**This is an IMPROVEMENT over the original feedback.** Great design decision.

---

### 2. Comprehensive Edge Case Handling

**Updated ADR addresses:**
- Target dies → Lock released, find new target
- Target despawns → Lock released, find new target
- Target exceeds leash → Lock released, give up chase
- Multiple players nearby → Ignore while locked
- GCD active during attack → Fail gracefully, retry next loop
- Heading changes during pathfinding → Second FaceTarget corrects

**Every edge case has clear, correct behavior.** This is robust systems design.

---

### 3. Extended Phase 6 Testing

**Updated ADR includes:**
- Sustained pressure test (queue fills in 3s)
- Target lock validation (ignores closer targets)
- Success rate metric (>80% target)
- Edge case coverage (death, despawn, leash)

**This testing plan validates the ENTIRE combat system, not just individual components.**

**If Phase 6 tests pass, ADRs 002-006 work together correctly.** This is the validation gate for MVP combat.

---

## Final Note to Developer

You've taken a technically solid but gameplay-flawed ADR and transformed it into a **robust, fun, testable combat system**.

The changes you made:
- TargetLock component (mandatory, not optional)
- Wait(1.0) instead of Wait(2.0)
- Double FaceTarget (before + after PathTo)
- FindOrKeepTarget (sticky targeting logic)
- Extended Phase 6 testing (validates full loop)

...are **exactly what the game needed**.

**This is how game development should work:**
1. ARCHITECT designs technically sound system
2. PLAYER identifies gameplay flaws
3. ARCHITECT revises design to address flaws
4. PLAYER validates fixes resolve issues

**Outcome: System that works AND is fun.**

**Well done. Now go implement it.** 🎮
